title: Creating a Jekyll Init Script
---

<p>
	Recently, I embarked on converting this site to use <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll">Jekyll</a> as a replacement for a 'real' CMS.
</p>
<p>
	Overall, the experience has been great, Jekyll has been a great tool to manage the templating of pages and I could see how it could be leveraged for a larger site.
	One thing I was not able to find was a decent daemon script for running Jekyll as a Linux service.  
	Jekyll can run until interrupted, automatically picking up changes and re-generating the pages.  
	I could run it as a background task, but that seemed awkward as I would have to start it whenever the server restarted.
</p>
<p>
	So I created my own.  It executes Jekyll, specifing the source and target destination and then pipes the output to a log file at /var/log/jekyll.log.  
	It also creates a PID file under /var/run/jekyll.pid, which it uses to get status and stop the service.  Right now it's not terribly intelligent, there's
	no checking to see if the service is already started for example.
